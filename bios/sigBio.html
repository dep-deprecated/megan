	<p>Paul Victor Jules Signac was a French neo-impressionist painter.  He worked with Georges Seurat to develop the pointillist style.  Signac began his career  in architecture before pursuing a painting career (decided at 18 after seeing an exhibit of Monet’s work).  He sailed the coasts of Europe, painting landscapes he saw, as well as a series of watercolor French harbor cities later on.  Shortly after meeting Monet and Seurat, he threw away the short brushstrokes of the impressionist style to begin experiment with pointillism.  Signac loved painting the water; spent many summers painting the French coast.  He met Vincent van Gogh in 1886, buddied up with him, and often painted river landscapes and cafes together.  Van Gogh admired Signac’s loose painting technique.  From his various travels, he returned with vibrant watercolor quick sketches, which he used to paint large studio canvasses that are created by small squares of color, different from the small dots used by Seurat.  Signac experienced with different media; oil paintings, watercolors, etchings, lithographs, and a collection of pen-and-ink sketches using small dots.  He was an influence to Henri Matisse, Andre Derain, and the Fauvism movement.  Signac encouraged younger artists by exhibiting the works of the Fauves and the Cubists.  He passed in August of 1935.
