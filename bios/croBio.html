	<p>Henri-Edmond Cross was a French painter and printmaker, and is most acclaimed as master of Neo-Impressionism.  Cross was extremely influential to Henri Matisse, Georges Seurat, and Paul Signac, and was a large influence to the development of Fauvism.  He painted under Carolus-Duran for one year, then under Francois Bonvin in Paris in 1875.  Cross studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and enrolled at the Ecoles Academiques de Dessin et d’Architecture for three years.  He continued his education under fellow Douai artist Emile Dupont-Zipcy after moving to Paris in 1881.  His early works, portraits, and still lifes were in the dark colors of Realism.  He changed his name in 1881 to Henri Cross to be able to be identified, rather than mistaken for the famous Romantic painter Eugene Delacroix.<br>
		In 1883 he took a trip to the Alpes-Maritimes with his family, and painted many landscapes.  He also painted a portrait of Dr. Soins, who was along for the trip, which ended up being exhibited at Nice’s Exposition Universelle that same year.  He met Paul Signac on the trip as well, who he befriended closely and was influenced by artistically.
	Cross co-founded the Societe des Artists Independants (a group which Signac, Seurat, and many other famous artists were members) to discuss and improve the practices of art exhibits and presented unjuried exhibitions without awards or prizes.  He did not adopt Seurat’s and Signac’s style until later; it was a gradual shift from his early, dark, Realist work.  Eventually his work became lighter and more impressionistic.  In the late 1880s, his landscapes strongly showed the influence of Claude Monet.  He attempted again to differentiate himself from another French artist, Henri Cros, so he finally adopted the name Henri-Edmond Cross.  His first large Neo-Impressionistic piece in an Independants show was a portrait of Madame Hector France (his future wife).  His anarchist beliefs influenced a lithograph he created in 1896 that was featured in an anarchist magazine, and influenced what he painted.  He often created scenes of a utopian world that would exist via anarchism.  His early- to mid- 1890s paintings are very Pointillist; he later gradually shifted his technique to using thick, blocky brushstrokes and leaving small exposed areas of bare canvas in between strokes.  This look resembled mosaics, and is accepted to be thought as a precursor to Fauvism and Cubism.</br>
	Cross died of cancer in Paris, days short of his 54th birthday in 1909.
