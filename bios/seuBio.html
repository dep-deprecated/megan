	<p>Georges-Pierre Seurat was a French Post-Impressionist Painter.  He is known to be the first to come up with pointillism.  He studied art at Ecole Municipale de Sculpture et Dessin, and later moved on to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.  He spent a year in Brest Military Academy, and returned to Paris and shared a studio with a friend, Aman-Jean.  Seurat spent his time mastering the technique of monochrome drawing (he studied the work of Delacroix and his use of color).  His first established work was a conte crayon drawing of Aman-Jean.  Seurat’s ideas on pointillism had strong influence on Signac.  <em>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte</em> took him two years to finish, is ten feet wide, and is now displayed at the Art Institute of Chicago.  It was in an inspiration for Stephen Sundheim’s musical <em>Sunday in the Park with George</em>.  He remained connected to color theorists’ notion of a scientific approach to painting.  He believed the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of heuristics, that would bear the name chromoluminanism.  This language is shown through thought-out use of line, color intensity, and color schema.  Seurat died in Paris in 1891, leaving his last ambitious work The Circus behind, unfinished.

	Quoted from a letter to Maurice Beaubourg, “Art is Harmony.  Harmony is the analogy of the contrary and of similar elements of tone, of color and of line, considered according to their dominance and under the influence of light, in gay, calm, or sad combinations.”
